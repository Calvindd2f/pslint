# Changelog

## v1.0

### Added or Changed

- Fixed back to top alignment (revert changes)
- Implemented pretty console output for CI
- Added output from the endblock that isn't completely awful looking

### Removed

- `pslint.ps1` : pslint function was redefined under the pslint.psm1 file so that the function is imported at the same time as the module itself.
